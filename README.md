# Lab Assignment 2: Extended Kalman Filtering

The goal of this project was to utilize the Kalman Filter (KF) to estimate the state of our two-wheeled robot. This project was a continuation of Lab Assignment 1: State Estimation. Thus, we used our mathematical model from lab 1 to derive a KF-based state estimation algorithm.
