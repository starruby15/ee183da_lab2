Each txt file has the arduino output of the car for different simulation runs. 

#### kf_test.txt 
A short test of the kalman filter that was used while coding it.  This is created data values to just see if the EKF is working. 

#### straight_test.txt
This is the input/measurement results of running the straight scenario as described in the lab report.  


#### turn.txt
This is the input/measurement results of running the turn scenario as described in the lab report.  


#### circle.txt
This is the input/measurement results of running turn code back to back to see if it results the robot circling around the board.  There were some errors with this as the robot did not fully circle smoothly, so it was not used for the lab report.  It is kept here in order to use the data to fix the current circling code in order to get that scenario working later.
