We tested the ability of the gyro to measure rotation for the various PWM of the car.  
Each of the video is the car turning at a different PWM level. 
We compared the observed rotational velocity in the videos to the rotational velocity outputted by the gyroscope.
Through this we are able to find the noise/error of the gyroscope.
